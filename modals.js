    description: "DeSo is the official Web3 sponsor of the MLH Hackathon League and the first Layer 1 blockchain custom-built for decentralized social media applications. While a blockchain like Avalanche costs $0.50+ to store just a 200-character post, the DeSo blockchain is built with custom indexing and storage optimizations which make it 10,000X cheaper to store social content on-chain! In order to qualify for the contest, build a hack that uses the DeSo API. While social media apps are a great fit for DeSo, you can also build financial apps, marketplaces, and more on the DeSo blockchain. To get started, sign up for a DiamondApp account, make a post tagging @deso with both your event hashtag & #MLH. The DeSo team will then send you even more $DESO coin to build your hackathon project!",
